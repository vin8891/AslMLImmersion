    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Grounding in Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/ground-language-models) lets you use generative text models to generate content grounded in your own documents and data. This capability lets the model access information at runtime that goes beyond its training data. By grounding model responses in data stores within [Vertex AI Agent Builder](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/enterprise-search-introduction), LLMs that are grounded in data can produce more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grounding provides the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces model hallucinations (instances where the model generates content that isn't factual)\n",
    "- Anchors model responses to specific information, documents, and data sources\n",
    "- Enhances the trustworthiness, accuracy, and applicability of the generated content"

    "- Compare the results of ungrounded LLM responses with grounded LLM responses\n",
    "- Create and use a data store in Vertex AI Search to ground responses in custom documents and data\n",
    "- Generate LLM text and chat model responses grounded in Vertex AI Search results\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the following Google Cloud AI services and resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vertex AI\n",
    "- Vertex AI Search and Conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps performed include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configuring the LLM and prompt for various examples\n",
    "- Sending example prompts to generative text and chat models in Vertex AI\n",
    "- Setting up a data store in Vertex AI Search with your own data\n",
